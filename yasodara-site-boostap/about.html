				<h1> History and Traditions </h1>
				<h2> A Brief Introduction to Yasodaravians' History </h2>
				<p>History is the record of events that took place and the history of Yasodara provides evidence for the present stability of the school.</p>
				<p>The school was founded in the year 1905 as a "Government English School", Gampaha which conducted its classes through the bilingual medium and on the first of January 1963 , the school received its present name Yasodara Devi Balika Maha Vidyalaya. As in 1962 the post primary classes of the school were taken to Bandaranayake Maha Vidyalaya under reorganization programs. At the initiation of the school there were only 888 students and there were classes for both boys and girls.  In 1964 the school was able to have a class for grade 9 and it was promoted to the state of a Maha Vidyalaya.</p>
				<p>With the initiation of GCE O/L classes in 1969 , Yasodara Devi Balika Maha Vidyalaya climbed another rung in the ladder of success. In 1984 , 123 students sat for GCE A/L examination for the first time marking another special event in the path of the history.
In 1979, the A/L commerce stream and in 1983 A/L science stream were initiated.</p>
				<h2>Founders of Yasodara</h2>
				<p>Yasodara bows her head to the former principals of the school , untiring efforts, determination and courage led the school to her present glorified status.</p>

				The first principal of the school was Mrs. Sunethra Abesinghe. Thanks to her dedicated service a great development in the educational aspect of the school was shown, as in 1965 the school was able to provide facilities for the students population increased along with the physical resources. So a science unit, a home science and economics   unit, an office and library were added to the school during her time. It is with gratitude Yasodara now remember the first principal of the school Mrs. Sunethra Abesinghe, for the initial steps she had taken of which we now reap the harvest.

				Yasodara  greatly appreciate the incomparable service Mrs. Saddha Abesekara, the second principal of the school. The initiation of A/L commerce stream in 1979 and the A/L science stream in 1983 can be considered as special achievements. The library of a school shows the diversity of knowledge. In 1981 , the addition of library lengthened up its avenues for success. The official initiation of the cadet platoon and the brilliant achievements shown in 1982, 1983,1984 and in 1985 spread the names of Yasodara all over the island reaching its climax of success winning the A.C.R.C. Zoyza Presidental challenge trophy in 1990 and in 1993.

	<h1>Principal's Message</h1>
	
	<p>
	I proudly reach you this moment paying homage to the name of Yasodara when it is about to be known all over the country through the web site of the school.</p>
	
	<p>I did not have even the remotest idea of becoming a principal when I was appointed as the teacher after becoming a Math Graduate on 01.01,1982 as I loved teaching very much. Yet, after passing the Educational Administrative service in the year 1999 when I was appointed as the directress in charge of the Primary Education the relationship with the students became much closer .Due to that cherished closeness or due to a worthy act done in a previous birth I was endowed with the exceptional opportunity of becoming the principal of Yasodara Devi Balika Maha Vidyalaya on 30.04.2008. There onwards the school which was formed by the strong hands of Mrs. Sunethra Abesinghe, the first principal of the school  and later developed by the dedication  and commitment  of the seven principals  proceed along the path of the progress  towards the goal ultimate of becoming one of the most distinguished schools of the island.</p>
	<p>The students of Yasodara fulfil their educational objectives within a framework of inner conviction with its strong foundation in religion. The daughters of Yasodara are inculcated by the school  with  rare and valued qualities of Devi Yasodara ,an outstanding and venerated figure in the Buddhist history. One of the main objectives of the school is to develop the character along with knowledge and wisdom and to gift the society with daughters bearing persistent adherence towards a Sri Lankan identity.</p>
<p>The school has clearly understood the fact that each child has specific skills and the school strives hard to identify the potentials and to develop them through the provision of diverse of educational opportunities and the school is fortunate enough to see the self assured and courageous daughters of Yasodara stepping forward along miscellaneous fields adorned with the proud awareness of their capabilities to win the island but also as a whole world. </p>
